# Election Audit Summary

The script developed to oversee this analysis can be modified to satisfy future analyses on elections. Similarly, if this were a federal election, we can use the same script and change the county to states. 
If I summarize,  no matter the number of candidates or counties, the script used to perform the Election Audit can be a valuable resource for the election commission
